# Chess Companion Development Notes

## Project Overview
An LLM-powered chess companion that provides expert-level analysis and commentary for live chess games. Built on the proven TV companion architecture, the system combines real-time position recognition, historical database analysis, and multimodal AI to deliver sophisticated chess insights.

## Core Concept and Goals

### Chess Companion Vision
- **Real-time position analysis**: 2-second chess position detection from video streams
- **Expert-level commentary**: Combines engine analysis + historical precedent + human expertise
- **Historical context**: Vector database of chess-significant positions with commentary
- **Live interaction**: Voice queries about current positions and hypothetical moves
- **Educational insights**: Strategic themes, tactical patterns, and historical comparisons
- **Broadcast integration**: Works with YouTube chess streams via Chromecast/HDMI capture

### Architecture Foundation
- Evolved from `tv_companion_with_transcription.py` proven architecture
- Specialized computer vision for chess board recognition
- Vector database for semantic position similarity search
- Multi-modal analysis combining visual, audio, and analytical data

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Production Ready Components
- **Real-time vision**: 2-second chess position detection (19x speedup from 40s baseline)
- **Chess-significant database**: 5,000+ tactical/strategic positions with dual enhancement
- **Expert-level analysis**: Combines Stockfish + historical precedent + human commentary
- **Live interaction**: Voice queries with broadcast context awareness
- **Multi-modal integration**: Video capture + audio transcription + analytical synthesis

### Key Performance Achievements
- **Vision breakthrough**: 40s ‚Üí 2s position detection using specialized Roboflow models
- **Quality filtering**: 100% chess-significant positions vs ~20% with arbitrary sampling
- **Dual enhancement**: Human expert commentary + systematic LLM analysis
- **Cost optimization**: $0.49 per 5,000 positions using Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite
- **Real-time capability**: Background processing with instant cached responses

### Architecture Highlights
- **Three-tier processing**: Scene detection ‚Üí FEN detection ‚Üí Position analysis
- **Parallel analysis**: Pre-computes both white/black perspectives
- **Vector database**: Semantic similarity search across chess positions
- **Broadcast context**: Automatic player color assignment and match context
- **Error resilience**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive fallback strategies

## Key Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. Vision System Revolution (40s ‚Üí 2s)
**Problem**: Original Gemini consensus vision took 40+ seconds, making real-time analysis impossible.

**Solution**: Specialized Roboflow computer vision pipeline
- **Board segmentation**: `chessboard-segmentation/1` (97%+ confidence)
- **Piece detection**: `chess-piece-detection-lnpzs/1` (direct FEN output)
- **Preprocessing optimization**: 1024√ó1024 sweet spot for speed/accuracy
- **Result**: 19x performance improvement with maintained accuracy

### 2. Chess-Significance Position Filtering
**Problem**: Arbitrary sampling (every 6th move) captured mostly boring positions.

**Solution**: Evaluation-swing based intelligent filtering
```python
def should_extract_position_smart(board, move_number, prev_eval):
    # Priority 1: Forced moves (checkmate, stalemate, check)
    # Priority 2: Large evaluation swings (tactical moments)  
    # Priority 3: Decisive advantages (winning positions)
    # No arbitrary sampling - only chess-significant moments
```

**Impact**: 100% chess-significant positions vs ~20% with random sampling

### 3. Dual Enhancement Architecture
**Innovation**: Combine human expert commentary with systematic LLM analysis
- **Human commentary extraction**: Parse PGN annotations from master games
- **LLM systematic analysis**: Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite for strategic themes
- **Embedding synthesis**: Both sources contribute to vector search content
- **Cost efficiency**: $0.49 per 5,000 positions (150x cheaper than original estimates)

### 4. Parallel Analysis Strategy
**Challenge**: Turn attribution (whose move is it?) from vision alone is brittle.

**Elegant Solution**: Pre-compute analysis for both white and black perspectives
- Sidesteps unreliable turn detection entirely
- User queries naturally indicate perspective ("What should Magnus do?")
- Instant responses using pre-cached analysis
- 2x computational cost for significantly better reliability

## Live Chess Companion Architecture

### Core Components
- **Background processing**: Three-tier system (scene detection, FEN detection, position analysis)
- **Vision pipeline**: Roboflow specialized models for chess board recognition
- **Analysis engine**: Combines Stockfish evaluation + vector database search + LLM synthesis
- **User interaction**: Voice queries with broadcast context awareness
- **Multi-modal integration**: HDMI capture + audio transcription + visual context

### Real-Time Processing Flow
```
1. Scene Detection (10-30s intervals): Detect camera angle/layout changes
2. FEN Detection (3-5s intervals): Monitor chess position changes  
3. Position Analysis (on change): Pre-compute white/black analysis
4. User Queries (instant): Serve cached analysis with fresh context
```

### User Experience
**Voice Commands Working**:
- *"What should Magnus play here?"* ‚Üí Analyzes current position from Magnus's perspective
- *"What happens if Nakamura takes that pawn?"* ‚Üí Hypothetical move analysis
- *"Pause, let me think about this position"* ‚Üí TV control integration
- *"What's the engine evaluation?"* ‚Üí Stockfish analysis with principal variation

## Current Capabilities & Limitations

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- **Real-time position recognition**: 2-second detection from video streams
- **Expert-level analysis**: Combines engine + historical + human commentary
- **Voice interaction**: Natural language queries about current positions
- **Broadcast context**: Automatic player identification and match awareness
- **TV control**: Search, play, pause chess content via voice commands
- **Educational insights**: Strategic themes, tactical patterns, historical comparisons

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
- **Single game focus**: Optimized for one chess stream at a time
- **Vision model dependency**: Requires specific Roboflow models for accuracy  
- **Commentary parsing**: Works best with clear broadcast layouts
- **Network dependent**: Requires stable internet for AI services
