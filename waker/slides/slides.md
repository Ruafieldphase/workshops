**Audio Interruption Crisis**
- Vision calls blocked the event loop
- Fixed with asyncio.to_thread()

**Controller Timing Nightmares**
- Microsecond button presses didn't register
- C-stick vs analog stick confusion
- Musical timing requirements (60 BPM)

**Native Live API Vision**
- Responds to every frame sent
- Lower fidelity than separate models
- Separate vision pipeline proved better
