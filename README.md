# Gemini Meetup Workshops

Welcome to the **Gemini Meetup Workshops** repository! This collection serves as a central hub for hands-on, educational, and experimental projects showcasing the power and versatility of Google's Gemini models and related AI technologies (such as CrewAI, PettingZoo, etc.).

Our goal is to provide practical, open-source examples that demonstrate cutting-edge AI applications, from intelligent agents playing games and generating content to embedding AI on edge devices. Whether you're a developer, AI enthusiast, or just curious, these workshops offer a fantastic way to dive deep into real-world Gemini implementations.
