# Unveiling Artifacts: An AI-Powered Interactive Content Platform

This project explores the cutting edge of AI-driven content creation, showcasing how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dynamically generate and refine interactive web experiences. It demonstrates a novel approach to building complex web applications, from physics simulations to interactive games, through an iterative and conversational workflow.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Capabilities

*   **AI-Powered Dynamic Content Generation:** Leverages sophisticated AI agents to create fully self-contained HTML documents, embedding all necessary CSS, JavaScript, and even images (as Base64 data URIs) directly within a single file for maximum portability and offline functionality.
*   **Iterative Design & Refinement:** Enables a unique multi-turn conversation with the LLM, feeding its previous output back as context. This allows for incremental construction and step-by-step refinement of complex web components and user interfaces.
*   **Dynamic Visual Storytelling:** Explores the creation of animatable SVGs and interactive timelines, enhancing data-driven narratives for subjects like the "History of LLMs" with fluid, programmable animations.
*   **Automated Interactive Demonstrations:** Features a robust mechanism to cycle through and showcase various interactive artifacts (e.g., a Tetris clone, Snake game, two-pendulum physics simulation) in an engaging, automated sequence, ideal for exhibitions or continuous displays.
*   **Effortless Serving & Local Development:** Includes a lightweight, robust static file server (Caddy) configured with appropriate CORS headers, streamlining the development and serving of these dynamic web artifacts.

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Highlights

This project showcases several innovative technical approaches:

*   **CrewAI Orchestration:** An `Artifactor` agent, designed as a "Web Developer/Designer," is orchestrated using `CrewAI` to manage the complex task of web artifact generation.
*   **LLM Contextual Memory:** A critical design decision involves passing the LLM's `previous_artifact` as context for subsequent generations, enabling true multi-turn conversations and stateful design iteration.
*   **Single-File Artifact Paradigm:** All generated web artifacts are engineered as single HTML files, embedding CSS, JavaScript, and even images as data URIs. This ensures maximum portability, offline functionality, and simplified distribution.
*   **Dynamic SVG Manipulation:** Leverages SVG's inherent scalability and DOM manipulability to create fluid, interactive graphs and timelines, allowing for programmatic animation and dynamic data visualization.
*   **Practical LLM Selection:** Demonstrates a real-world solution to LLM limitations, where switching from `gemini-1.5-pro` to `gemini-1.5-flash` successfully resolved content truncation issues, ensuring complete and functional artifact generation.
