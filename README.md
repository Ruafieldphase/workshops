# üåü Gemini Meetup Workshops

Welcome to the **Gemini Meetup Workshops** repository! This collection is a dynamic showcase of projects and demonstrations built using Google's Gemini models and related AI technologies. Designed for hands-on learning, each subproject explores unique applications of large language models (LLMs), from creating AI agents that play games to generating dynamic content and integrating AI with hardware.

Whether you're looking to understand multi-agent systems, delve into real-time AI applications, or see how LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, you'll find a wealth of practical examples here.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore any of the workshop projects:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/workshops.git
    cd workshops
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired project directory:** Each subproject is self-contained. For example, to explore the `smash` project:
    ```bash
    cd smash/
    ```
3.  **Read the project's `README.md`:** Every subproject has its own `README.md` with detailed instructions on setup, prerequisites, and how to run the specific demonstration.
4.  **Install dependencies and run:** Follow the instructions within each project's `README.md` to install Python dependencies (often with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install`), set up API keys, and launch the application.
