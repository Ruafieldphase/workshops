## Getting Started

### 1. Hardware Setup
```bash
# Set up HDMI video loopback for capture
./chess/setup_hdmi_loopback.sh
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Configure API keys
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY="your_roboflow_api_key"
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Build chess positions database (optional - pre-built available)
poetry run python build_database.py input.pgn 5000 output.json
```

### 4. Launch Chess Companion
```bash
# Start with debug mode for development
poetry run python chess_companion_standalone.py --debug

# Production mode
poetry run python chess_companion_standalone.py
```

## Example Interactions

### Position Analysis
```
You: "What should Magnus play in this position?"
Companion: "Magnus, playing Black, should consider Nf6, developing the knight 
           while maintaining central control. The engine evaluates this at -0.3, 
           slightly favoring Black. This position is similar to Game 4 from the 
           2021 World Championship where Magnus used similar piece coordination..."
```

### Hypothetical Scenarios  
```
You: "What happens if he takes the pawn with the rook?"
Companion: "If Rxe5, the position changes from +0.2 to -0.8 after dxe5, 
           opening the d-file for White's rook. This tactical shot improves 
           White's position significantly, similar to the breakthrough 
           Carlsen achieved against Nepo in their rapid match..."
```

### Content Control
```
You: "Can you play the Hikaru vs Magnus game from yesterday?"
Companion: "üé¨ Bringing up 'Hikaru vs Magnus'... 
           [Searches YouTube and starts playback]
           This looks like their Speed Chess Championship match. 
           Should I analyze the current position?"
```
