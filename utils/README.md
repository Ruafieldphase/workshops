# ðŸš€ LLM Demonstration Workshop Project

Welcome to the README for our workshop project! This repository serves as a practical demonstration of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications, showcasing both powerful new capabilities and robust development practices.

## What This Project Does

This project is designed to illustrate advanced LLM capabilities through automated content generation and seamless deployment. It dynamically produces presentable content, such as real-time news summaries and LLM cost comparisons, making complex concepts easy to visualize and explore. Our goal is to provide a working example of how LLMs can generate valuable, shareable artifacts.

## Key Features & Capabilities

*   **LLM-Driven News Summarization:** Leveraging Google's Gemini models (`gemini-1.5-flash`) and `newsapi`, the project fetches real-time articles and summarizes them on demand, demonstrating live data integration with LLMs.
*   **Automated Demonstration Generation:** Automatically builds and publishes various "slides" or reports, including LLM cost comparisons, feature recaps, and live factuality demonstrations.
*   **Robust CI/CD Pipeline:** Utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the generation and deployment of these demonstration artifacts directly to GitHub Pages, ensuring fresh content is always available.
*   **Developer Experience Enhancements:** Incorporates `pre-commit` hooks for code quality, formatting, and linting, fostering a consistent and high-quality codebase.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implements best practices for API key handling via `utils` modules and `params_default.py` templates.

## Quick Start / Usage

This project primarily functions as a demonstration platform, with its outputs published directly.

1.  **Explore Live Demonstrations:** The core output of this project is a set of "slides" and generated content deployed to GitHub Pages.
    *   Visit the project's deployed content here: **[https://[YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL_HERE]](https://[YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL_HERE])**
    *   *(Note: The exact URL depends on your repository name and GitHub Pages setup. Please check the "Pages" section in your repository settings if the link above is not active.)*
    *   Here you can interact with the generated cost comparisons and see the real-time news summarization in action.

2.  **Inspect the Codebase:** For a deeper dive into how everything works:
    *   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO].git`
    *   Explore the `utils` directory for LLM integrations and helper functions.
    *   Review the `.github/workflows` directory to understand the CI/CD pipeline.

## Technical Highlights

*   **Advanced LLM Integration:** Demonstrates practical use of `langchain_google_genai` with `gemini-1.5-flash`, addressing common challenges like model truncation and API key management during development.
*   **Intelligent Content Extraction:** Utilizes `pyparsing` to robustly extract structured data from LLM outputs, ensuring reliability for downstream processing.
*   **Production-Ready CI/CD:** Showcases a sophisticated GitHub Actions setup for continuous artifact generation and deployment, highlighting how to automate content updates from code.
*   **Proactive Code Quality:** Implementation of `pre-commit` hooks ensures that code adheres to predefined standards, improving maintainability and collaboration.
*   **Strategic Design Choices:** Illustrates real-world development decisions, such as pivoting LLM models (`gemini-1.5-pro` to `gemini-1.5-flash`) to optimize performance and reliability for specific use cases.
