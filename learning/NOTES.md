# Pedagogical Concept Graph (PCG) - Design Notes

## Question: Is the PCG a Union of the Three JSON Files?

**Short answer:** Almost, but not quite a simple union!

## The Multi-Layer Structure

The complete PCG is assembled from three complementary passes, each focusing on a different cognitive task:

### Pass 1: Structure (The Skeleton ü¶¥)
**File:** `paip-chapter-1-pcg-pass1.json`

**Purpose:** Extract the graph topology and basic concept information

**Contains:**
- Graph nodes with:
  - `id` (unique identifier)
  - `name` (human-readable)
  - `description` (brief explanation)
  - `prerequisites` (list of concept IDs)
  - `difficulty` (basic/intermediate/advanced)
  - `section` (chapter reference)
- Graph edges defining prerequisite relationships
- Statistics about graph structure

**Key output:** This creates the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (33 concepts, 45 edges)

---

### Pass 2: Mastery Criteria (The Flesh üß†)
**File:** `paip-chapter-1-pcg-pass2-sample.json`

**Purpose:** Design learning objectives and assessment for each concept

**Enriches existing nodes with:**
- `learning_objectives` - what students should be able to DO
- `mastery_indicators` - specific testable skills with difficulty levels
- `examples` - code/text demonstrating the concept
- `misconceptions` - common student errors
- `key_insights` - important takeaways

**Key insight:** This doesn't create new nodes, it adds pedagogical flesh to the skeleton from Pass 1

**Status:** üöß Sample only (3 of 33 concepts enriched as proof-of-concept)

---

### Pass 3: Exercise Mapping (Assessment Layer üìù)
**File:** `paip-chapter-1-pcg-pass3.json`

**Purpose:** Map textbook exercises to concepts they test

**Contains:**
- `exercises` array with:
  - Exercise prompt and context
  - `tests_concepts` - which concepts this exercise assesses
  - Which `mastery_indicators` it probes
  - Example solutions
  - Common mistakes and hints
- `concept_to_exercises` - reverse index (concept ‚Üí exercises)
- `exercise_progressions` - recommended orderings

**Key insight:** Exercises are separate from concepts but reference them. This is a distinct layer, not merged into concept nodes.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (5 exercises mapped to 10 concepts)

---

## How They Merge Together

### The Complete PCG Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "combined from all three passes"
  },
  
  "concepts": [
    {
      // From Pass 1 (structure):
      "id": "recursion",
      "name": "Recursion",
      "description": "Functions calling themselves to solve problems",
      "prerequisites": ["defun", "function_application", "list_accessors"],
      "difficulty": "advanced",
      "section": "1.6",
      
      // Added from Pass 2 (mastery):
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Identify the base case and recursive case",
        "Trace execution mentally",
        "Explain termination reasoning",
        "Write recursive functions"
      ],
      
      "mastery_indicators": [
        {
          "skill": "base_case_identification",
          "description": "Can identify stopping condition",
          "difficulty": "basic",
          "test_method": "Show function, ask to point out base case"
        },
        {
          "skill": "recursive_writing",
          "description": "Can write recursive function for novel problem",
          "difficulty": "advanced",

        }
      ],
      
      "examples": [
        {
          "content": "(defun first-name (name) ...)",
          "explanation": "Recursive function stripping titles",
          "when_to_show": "first_introduction",
          "demonstrates": ["base_case", "recursive_case"]
        }
      ],
      
      "misconceptions": [
        {
          "misconception": "Recursion is mysterious or magical",
          "reality": "It's just a function call to itself",
          "correction_strategy": "Show it's identical to any function call"
        }
      ],
      
      "key_insights": [
        "Every recursive function has at least one base case",
        "Each recursive call must make progress toward base case",
        "Use 'leap of faith' - trust the recursive call works"
      ]
    }
  ],
  
  "edges": [
    /* From Pass 1 - prerequisite relationships */
    {"from": "recursion", "to": "defun", "type": "requires"}
  ],
  
  "exercises": [
    /* From Pass 3 - separate assessment layer */
    {
      "id": "ex_1_2",
      "title": "Exponentiation function",
      "tests_concepts": [
        {
          "concept_id": "recursion",
          "mastery_indicators": [
            "recursive_writing",
            "base_case",
            "termination_reasoning"
          ],
          "weight": "primary"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  
  "concept_to_exercises": {
    /* From Pass 3 - reverse index for lookups */
    "recursion": {
      "exercises": ["ex_1_1", "ex_1_2", "ex_1_3", "ex_1_4", "ex_1_5"],
      "note": "All exercises can be solved recursively"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Merge Strategy

### Pass 1 + Pass 2: Deep Merge
- **Operation:** Merge on `concept.id`
- **Result:** Complete concept nodes with structure AND pedagogy
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  for concept in pass2_concepts:
      pass1_concept = find_by_id(pass1, concept.id)
      pass1_concept.update({
          "learning_objectives": concept.learning_objectives,
          "mastery_indicators": concept.mastery_indicators,
          "examples": concept.examples,
          "misconceptions": concept.misconceptions,
          "key_insights": concept.key_insights
      })
  ```

### Pass 3: Separate Layer
- **Operation:** Keep exercises as separate array
- **Relationship:** Exercises reference concepts via `concept_id`
- **Reverse index:** `concept_to_exercises` enables fast lookup
- **Why separate?** Exercises are not concepts; they're assessment instruments

---

## Current Status & Next Steps

### What We Have ‚úÖ
1. **Pass 1 complete:** All 33 concepts with structure
2. **Pass 2 sample:** 3 concepts fully enriched (proof-of-concept)
3. **Pass 3 complete:** All 5 chapter exercises mapped

### What's Missing üöß
- **Pass 2 full enrichment:** Need to enrich remaining 30 concepts
- **Merge script:** Tool to combine all three passes into single PCG
- **Validation:** Check consistency across passes

### Implementation Plan
1. Complete Pass 2 enrichment for all concepts
2. Write merge utility: `bin/pcg_merge.py`
3. Validate merged PCG:
   - All concept_ids referenced in Pass 3 exist in Pass 1
   - No orphaned mastery_indicators
   - Prerequisite chains are valid
4. Generate final: `paip-chapter-1-pcg-complete.json`

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Multi-Pass?

**Cognitive separation:** Each pass is a distinct cognitive task:
- **Pass 1:** "What are the concepts and how do they relate?" (graph thinking)
- **Pass 2:** "How do we teach and assess each concept?" (pedagogical design)
- **Pass 3:** "Which exercises test which concepts?" (assessment mapping)

**LLM focus:** Each prompt can focus on one type of extraction without cognitive overload

**Incremental refinement:** Can validate structure before investing in detailed pedagogy

**Alternative considered:** Single-pass extraction with structured output
- **Pros:** Simpler, one API call per concept
- **Cons:** Harder to prompt well, lower quality, all-or-nothing

**Decision:** Multi-pass provides better quality at cost of complexity

### Why Exercises Separate?

**Different entity type:** Exercises are not concepts; they're instruments to measure concept mastery

**Many-to-many relationship:** One exercise can test multiple concepts; one concept tested by multiple exercises

**Reusability:** Same concept graph can be used with different exercise sets

**Queryability:** Need to ask both:
- "Which exercises test recursion?" ‚Üí `concept_to_exercises`
- "Which concepts does ex_1_2 test?" ‚Üí `exercises[].tests_concepts`

---

## Key Insights from This Discussion

1. **PCG is multi-layered, not flat**
   - Structure layer (DAG)
   - Pedagogy layer (objectives, assessment)
   - Exercise layer (assessment instruments)

2. **Passes 1+2 merge, Pass 3 stays separate**
   - Merge creates complete concept nodes
   - Exercises reference concepts but remain distinct

3. **Pass 2 sample validates the approach**
   - 3 concepts show the enrichment pattern
   - Ready to scale to all 33 concepts

4. **The complete PCG enables dialectic generation**
   - Structure tells us teaching order (topological sort)
   - Pedagogy tells us what to teach and how to assess
   - Exercises provide ready-made assessment problems

## Discovering Root Nodes: Visual Learning Entry Points

### The Root Node Problem

After implementing the reversed arrows (showing learning progression), we examined the visualization and made an important observation:

**Question:** "Does the graph imply that REPL and Symbols are both roots?"

**Answer:** Yes! Both have:
- ‚úì Arrows pointing OUT (to dependent concepts)
- ‚úì NO arrows pointing IN (no prerequisites)
- **Conclusion:** These are ROOT nodes - valid starting points for learning

### Semantic Validation

These roots make pedagogical sense for PAIP Chapter 1:

1. **Interactive REPL**
   - You need a REPL environment to experiment with Lisp
   - Hands-on, exploratory learning style
   - "Learn by doing" entry point

2. **Symbols**
   - The fundamental data type in Lisp
   - Building block for everything else
   - "Learn theory first" entry point

Both are legitimate starting points. Different learners with different backgrounds and preferences might choose different entry points.

### UX Design: Onboarding New Learners

**Challenge:** When a user first views the graph, how do we help them start?

**Recommendation:** Guided but non-prescriptive approach

#### Proposed Solution

**1. Visual Highlighting of Roots**
- Add subtle glow or special border to root nodes
- Use distinctive styling (e.g., lighter shade of green)
- Optional "START HERE" badge

**2. Welcome Modal on First Visit**
```
Welcome to PAIP Chapter 1!

This graph shows how Lisp concepts build on each other.
Start with one of the highlighted "root" concepts:

‚Ä¢ Interactive REPL - Learn by experimenting
‚Ä¢ Symbols - Understand Lisp's fundamental data type

Click a concept to see details, then follow arrows to see what's next!
```

**3. User Choice**
- Let the user click to choose their starting point
- No forced path - respects learner autonomy
- Graph remains explorable and non-linear

#### Design Rationale

**Preserves Autonomy:**
- Different learners have different backgrounds
- REPL-experienced developers might prefer hands-on start
- Theory-first learners might prefer Symbols

**Reduces Decision Paralysis:**
- Makes it clear there are only 2 starting points (not 33)
- Simplifies the initial learning decision

**Educational:**
- Tooltip explains how to read the graph
- Sets expectations for how arrows show progression

**Non-Intrusive:**
- After dismissing welcome message, free exploration
- No persistent UI clutter

#### Alternative Approach: Opinionated Pedagogy

If the textbook author believes one path is strictly superior:
- Default-select one root (e.g., "Interactive REPL") with highlight
- Still allow clicking on other root (Symbols)
- Nudges without forcing

**Our choice:** Keep it non-prescriptive. The book itself doesn't mandate a strict order for these foundational concepts.

### Implementation Status

- [x] Arrow direction reversed to show learning flow
- [x] Root nodes identified (Interactive REPL, Symbols)
- [ ] Visual styling for root nodes (TODO)
- [ ] Welcome modal/tooltip (TODO)
- [ ] First-visit detection (localStorage) (TODO)

---

## Learning Path Progression: Design Decisions

### The Core Challenge

Once a learner starts at a root concept (e.g., "Interactive REPL" or "Symbols"), **how should they progress through the graph?**

Key questions:
1. What order should concepts be learned?
2. How do we respect both **prerequisites** and **difficulty levels**?
3. How do we provide guidance without forcing a single path?
4. How do we visually communicate progress and next steps?

---

### Progression Strategy Options

#### Option 1: "Greedy Ready" ‚≠ê *Recommended*

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
function getRecommendedNext(masteredConcepts) {
  // Find all concepts whose prerequisites are satisfied
  const ready = concepts.filter(c => 
    !masteredConcepts.includes(c.id) &&
    c.prerequisites.every(p => masteredConcepts.includes(p))
  );
  
  // Sort by difficulty (basic ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced)
  // Tie-breaker: which unlocks more concepts?
  return ready.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.difficulty !== b.difficulty) {
      return difficultyRank[a.difficulty] - difficultyRank[b.difficulty];
    }
    return countUnlocks(b) - countUnlocks(a);
  }).slice(0, 5); // Top 5 recommendations
}
```

**How it works:**
1. At any moment, identify all concepts whose prerequisites are **satisfied**
2. Among "ready to learn" concepts, **prioritize by difficulty**: Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced
3. Within same difficulty, prefer concepts that unlock more downstream concepts
4. Present top 3-5 as recommendations; user chooses

**Example progression from Symbols:**
```
Symbols ‚úì (mastered)
  ‚Üì
Ready: Lists, Quote, Variables, FunctionRefSyntax, Assignment (all Basic)
User picks: Lists ‚úì
  ‚Üì
Ready: ListAccessors, ListConstructors, NIL, Sublists, Quote, Variables, ... (all Basic)
User picks: NIL ‚úì
  ‚Üì
Ready: [previous] + NestedExpressions (newly unlocked)
  ‚Üì
... continues ...
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Respects dependencies (never suggests something you're not ready for)
- ‚úÖ Natural difficulty progression (build foundation before tackling hard concepts)
- ‚úÖ Always shows forward progress
- ‚úÖ User retains choice among ready concepts
- ‚úÖ Optimizes for unlocking (prefers concepts that open up more paths)

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May jump between branches (not strict depth-first within one subtree)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires computing "ready set" on each state change

---

#### Option 2: Depth-First by Difficulty

**Algorithm:**
1. Start at root (e.g., Symbols)
2. Follow one path, learning ALL basic concepts until hitting intermediate/advanced
3. Backtrack, try next basic path
4. Once all reachable basics are exhausted, tackle intermediates
5. Finally tackle advanced concepts

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Master all easy material before harder concepts
- ‚úÖ Builds solid foundation systematically

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå May get "stuck" - a basic concept deep in a branch might be blocked by intermediate concepts
- ‚ùå Less natural flow (why learn one branch completely before touching another?)
- ‚ùå Arbitrary which branch to follow first

**Verdict:** Too rigid; doesn't respect natural learning curiosity

---

#### Option 3: Breadth-First (Level-by-Level)

**Algorithm:**
1. Master root (Symbols)
2. Master ALL direct children (Lists, Quote, Variables, etc.)
3. Master all grandchildren
4. Continue level-by-level down the DAG

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Systematic coverage
- ‚úÖ Clear sense of progress (depth levels)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Ignores difficulty - might attempt advanced concepts before having sufficient foundation
- ‚ùå Can feel forced (why must I learn ALL siblings before any children?)
- ‚ùå Doesn't optimize for learning efficiency

**Verdict:** Too mechanical; treats all concepts equally regardless of difficulty

---

#### Option 4: Interest-Driven with Smart Suggestions

**Algorithm:**
1. User can click ANY node at any time to inspect status
2. System shows clear visual states (locked/ready/mastered)
3. System highlights "recommended next" using Greedy Ready algorithm
4. User can follow recommendations OR jump to any ready concept

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum learner autonomy
- ‚úÖ System provides guidance without forcing
- ‚úÖ Respects intrinsic motivation ("I'm curious about recursion!")
- ‚úÖ Learner can optimize for their own goals

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User might make suboptimal choices (attempting concepts before ready)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires excellent UI to communicate locked vs. ready states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some learners prefer more structure/direction

**Verdict:** Good for advanced learners; might overwhelm beginners

---

### Our Design: Hybrid "Guided Greedy Ready"

**Approach:** Combine the structure of Greedy Ready (Option 1) with the autonomy of Interest-Driven (Option 4)

**Key principles:**
1. **Guide, don't force:** Highlight recommended next steps, but allow exploration
2. **Make readiness obvious:** Clear visual distinction between locked, ready, and mastered
3. **Provide context:** When user clicks locked concept, show prerequisite chain
4. **Celebrate progress:** Visual feedback when concepts are mastered and new concepts unlock

---

### Visual State Design

The graph uses five distinct visual states to communicate learning status:

#### üëë Mastered (Completed)
- **Background:** Gold/yellow gradient
- **Icon:** ‚úì checkmark badge
- **Border:** Solid gold (3px)
- **Opacity:** 100% (stay visible)
- **Interaction:** Click ‚Üí "What this unlocked" + review learning objectives

**Why gold?** Positive reinforcement; achievement; valuable progress

#### ‚ú® Recommended Next (Top 3-5 ready concepts)
- **Background:** Original difficulty color (green/blue/red)
- **Glow:** Pulsing green animation (subtle, 1.5s cycle)
- **Border:** Bright green (2px)
- **Icon:** ‚≠ê star or sparkles
- **Interaction:** Click ‚Üí "Start Learning" modal

**Why pulse?** Draws attention without being distracting; suggests "this is active/available"

#### ‚úÖ Ready to Learn (Prerequisites met, but not top recommendation)
- **Background:** Original difficulty color
- **Brightness:** +10% brighter than locked
- **Border:** Normal
- **Opacity:** 100%
- **Interaction:** Click ‚Üí "Start Learning" modal

**Why brighter?** Distinguishable from locked, but less attention-grabbing than recommended

#### üîì Almost Ready (Missing 1-2 prerequisites)
- **Background:** Original difficulty color
- **Opacity:** 60%
- **Border:** Dashed gray
- **Badge:** "1 away" or "2 away"
- **Interaction:** Click ‚Üí Show what's blocking + shortest path

**Why show this?** Motivates learners to see they're close; helps planning

#### üîí Locked (Missing 3+ prerequisites)
- **Background:** Original difficulty color
- **Opacity:** 30%
- **Icon:** üîí padlock overlay
- **Border:** None
- **Interaction:** Click ‚Üí Show prerequisite tree + shortest path to unlock

**Why locked?** Clear visual signal that this is not accessible yet

---

### Example User Journey

```
=== START ===
User lands on visualizer
Graph shows: Interactive REPL and Symbols glowing as roots
Welcome modal: "Start with Interactive REPL or Symbols!"

User clicks: Symbols
Modal displays:
  - Description
  - Learning objectives
  - Examples
  - [Start Learning] button

=== AFTER MASTERING SYMBOLS ===
Graph updates:
  ‚úì Symbols ‚Üí gold with checkmark
  ‚ú® 5 concepts start pulsing: Lists, Quote, Variables, FunctionRefSyntax, Assignment
  üìä Stats panel: "5 new concepts unlocked!"
  üéâ Subtle confetti animation (optional)

User hovers: Lists (recommended)
Tooltip: "‚≠ê Recommended ‚Ä¢ Basic ‚Ä¢ Unlocks 4 concepts"

User clicks: Lists
Modal: Learning objectives + [Start Learning]

=== USER GETS CURIOUS ===
User clicks: Recursion (locked, advanced, needs 5 prerequisites)
Modal shows:
  "üîí Not ready yet! You need:
   ‚úì Symbols (done!)
   üîí Defun
   üîí Function Application
   üîí List Accessors
   
   üìç Shortest path:
   You ‚Üí Defun ‚Üí List Accessors ‚Üí Function Application ‚Üí Recursion
   (Estimated 3 concepts away)
   
   [Show Path on Graph] button"

User clicks: [Show Path on Graph]
Graph highlights: recommended path with animated arrows

User: "Ah, I see!" Follows the path
```

---

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Basic Progress Tracking ‚úÖ *Complete*
- [x] Track masteredConcepts in localStorage
- [x] Visual distinction for mastered (gold + checkmark)
- [x] Stats panel showing mastered/in-progress/ready/locked counts
- [x] Click concept to mark as mastered/in-progress

#### Phase 2: Smart Recommendations üöß *Next*
- [ ] Implement `getReadyConcepts(mastered)` algorithm
- [ ] Add "Recommended Next" visual state (pulsing glow)
- [ ] Sort recommendations by difficulty + unlock potential
- [ ] Display recommended concepts in sidebar

#### Phase 3: Dependency Visualization
- [ ] Implement `getLockedReasons(conceptId, mastered)`
- [ ] Show prerequisite tree when clicking locked concept
- [ ] Calculate and display "shortest path to unlock"
- [ ] Highlight paths on graph with animated flow

#### Phase 4: Enhanced Learning Flow
- [ ] Add "Start Learning" modal with objectives
- [ ] Track "in-progress" state (started but not mastered)
- [ ] Show "What this unlocked" when completing a concept
- [ ] Add celebration animations for milestones

#### Phase 5: Pedagogical Integration
- [ ] Display learning objectives from Pass 2 data
- [ ] Show examples and misconceptions
- [ ] Link to exercises that test this concept (Pass 3)
- [ ] Track time spent per concept

---

### Design Tradeoffs

#### Autonomy vs. Guidance
**Tension:** Some learners want clear prescribed paths; others want freedom to explore

**Our choice:** Guide with recommendations, but allow clicking any ready concept
- Beginners can follow the glowing path
- Advanced learners can explore based on interest
- System always prevents tackling concepts before prerequisites are met

#### Visual Clutter vs. Information Richness
**Tension:** More visual states = more information, but also more complexity

**Our choice:** Five states is the maximum before it becomes overwhelming
- We group concepts with 3+ missing prerequisites into single "locked" state
- "Almost ready" (1-2 away) gets special treatment because it's actionable

#### Optimizing for Speed vs. Depth
**Tension:** Fastest path through graph vs. deepest understanding

**Our choice:** Recommend easiest-first, but don't prevent tackling harder concepts
- Default path builds solid foundation
- Advanced learners can skip ahead if prerequisites are met
- System never lies about readiness

---

### Future Enhancements

#### Adaptive Recommendations
Use learning history to personalize recommendations:
- If user consistently chooses advanced concepts, suggest those more
- If user struggles with a difficulty level, recommend more prerequisites
- Track time-to-mastery and adjust pace

#### Multiple Learning Styles
Offer different progression presets:
- "Breadth-first explorer" - level-by-level
- "Depth-first specialist" - one subtree at a time
- "Efficient speedrunner" - shortest path to advanced concepts
- "Thorough scholar" - revisit and reinforce frequently

#### Social Features
- Share your learning path with others
- See what path other learners took
- "Racing" mode - compete to master concepts fastest
- Collaborative learning - discuss concepts with peers

#### Spaced Repetition
- Mark mastered concepts for review after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months
- Periodic "knowledge checks" on previously mastered material
- Adjust visual state if review is needed ("needs refresh")

# Pedagogical Concept Graph (PCG) - Visualization Notes

## Overview

This document captures design decisions and technical discussions around visualizing the Pedagogical Concept Graph for PAIP Chapter 1.

## Visualization Library Selection

### Libraries Evaluated

We considered three JavaScript visualization libraries for rendering the PCG:

#### 1. **Cytoscape.js** ‚≠ê *Selected*
- **Strengths:**
  - Excellent for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
  - Built-in layouts specifically for hierarchical graphs (breadthfirst, dagre)
  - Easy to style nodes and edges
  - Good performance for medium-sized graphs (33 nodes)
  - Rich interaction API (click, hover, selection)
  - Well-documented and actively maintained
  
- **Use cases:** Network diagrams, dependency graphs, prerequisite trees
- **Verdict:** Best fit for PCG visualization

#### 2. **D3.js**
- **Strengths:**
  - Most flexible and powerful
  - Complete control over every visual aspect
  - Beautiful, custom visualizations possible
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Steeper learning curve
  - More code required for basic features
  - Need to implement graph layout algorithms manually
  
- **Use cases:** Custom, highly-tailored visualizations; data journalism
- **Verdict:** Overkill for our needs

#### 3. **Sigma.js**
- **Strengths:**
  - Optimized for large graphs (thousands of nodes)
  - WebGL rendering for performance
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Less suitable for DAGs
  - Fewer built-in hierarchical layouts
  - Better for network exploration than learning paths
  
- **Use cases:** Social networks, large-scale graph exploration
- **Verdict:** Not ideal for structured learning graphs

### Final Decision: Cytoscape.js

**Rationale:** Cytoscape.js offers the best balance of ease-of-use, built-in support for hierarchical layouts, and features specifically suited for dependency/prerequisite graphs.

---

## Visualization Approaches Considered

We identified three potential visualization strategies corresponding to the three passes of PCG generation:

### Option A: Structure Only (Pass 1) ‚≠ê *Selected*
- **Data source:** `paip-chapter-1-pcg-pass1.json`
- **Shows:**
  - Concept nodes with names and difficulty levels
  - Prerequisite edges (dependency relationships)
  - Basic metadata (section, description)
- **Color coding:** By difficulty (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Layout:** Hierarchical (breadthfirst or dagre)
- **Interactions:**
  - Click node ‚Üí show details
  - Highlight dependencies when selected
  - Filter by difficulty
  - Multiple layout options

**Why we chose this:** Clean, focused, and sufficient for understanding the learning structure. Avoids overwhelming users with too much information upfront.

### Option B: Structure + Mastery (Pass 1 + Pass 2)
- Everything from Option A, plus:
  - Mastery indicators for each concept
  - Learning objectives
  - Example code snippets on hover/click
  - Misconceptions and key insights
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Use case:** More detailed learning support

### Option C: Complete View (All 3 Passes)
- Everything from Options A & B, plus:
  - Exercise-to-concept mappings
  - Exercise difficulty and estimated time
  - Multiple solution approaches

## Graph Direction Convention: A Critical Design Decision

### The Problem

During implementation, we discovered an important ambiguity in how to represent the graph edges:

**Semantic meaning vs. Visual flow**

The JSON data represents edges as:
```json
{"from": "prefix_notation", "to": "interactive_repl", "type": "requires"}
```

This means: **"prefix_notation requires interactive_repl"** (semantically correct ‚úì)

However, when visualized, this creates arrows pointing:
```
prefix_notation ‚Üí interactive_repl
```

This makes `interactive_repl` look like a **leaf** (dead end) rather than a **root** (starting point).

### The Confusion

For a **learning path visualization**, we typically want:
- Arrows to show "what you can learn next"
- Start at prerequisites (roots), follow arrows forward to advanced concepts
- Natural flow: `interactive_repl ‚Üí prefix_notation` (learn REPL first, THEN prefix notation)

But our semantic meaning is backwards from the visual learning flow!

### The Solution: Flip Arrows at Render Time

**Decision:** Keep the data structure semantic meaning, but reverse arrow direction during visualization.

**Why this approach:**
1. **Data stays semantically correct:** "X requires Y" is intuitive in code
2. **Visualization shows learning progression:** Arrows flow from prerequisites to dependent concepts
3. **Best of both worlds:** Semantic correctness + visual intuitiveness

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In visualizer code:
elements: [
  ...data.edges.map(e => ({
    data: { 
      source: e.to,    // FLIP: prerequisite as source
      target: e.from,  // FLIP: dependent concept as target
      type: e.type
    }
  }))
]
```

### Query Implications

**Important:** This reversal is **only for visualization**. The underlying data structure remains optimal for all common queries:

#### Query 1: What prerequisites does X need?
```javascript
function getPrerequisites(nodeId) {
  return edges
    .filter(e => e.from === nodeId)
    .map(e => e.to);
}
// No inversion needed ‚úì
```

#### Query 2: I finished X, what's next?
```javascript
function whatCanILearnNext(completedNodeId) {
  return edges
    .filter(e => e.to === completedNodeId)
    .map(e => e.from);
}
// No inversion needed ‚úì
```

#### Query 3: Full dependency tree for X
```javascript
function getAllPrerequisites(nodeId) {
  // BFS/DFS following edges where e.from === nodeId
  // No inversion needed ‚úì
}
```

#### Query 4: What depends on X?
```javascript
function getDependents(nodeId) {
  return edges
    .filter(e => e.to === nodeId)
    .map(e => e.from);
}
// No inversion needed ‚úì
```

**Conclusion:** The data structure "X requires Y" supports all queries naturally. We only flip arrows for visual intuition‚Äîthe semantic model stays clean.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Graph Direction Matters
The direction of edges in a dependency graph has both **semantic** and **visual** implications. Design your data model for semantic clarity, then adapt the visualization to match user expectations.

### 2. Start Simple
We consciously chose Option A (structure only) over Options B/C. It's easier to add complexity than to remove it. The simple version is already useful and provides a solid foundation.

### 3. Interactive Exploration > Static Diagrams
The ability to filter, highlight dependencies, and explore different layouts makes the graph much more useful than a static image. Interactivity is worth the implementation effort.

### 4. Library Choice Matters
Cytoscape.js made this implementation straightforward. Trying to build this with D3.js would have taken 3-5x more code. Choose tools that match your problem domain.
