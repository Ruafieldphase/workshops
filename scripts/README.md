# Workshop Project: LLM-Powered Content Generation & Developer Experience

This project provides a robust framework for generating various types of content, including presentation slides and factual summaries, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It emphasizes creating a highly efficient developer experience, automating deployment workflows, and ensuring high code quality.

## What This Project Does

This project is an advanced system designed to automate the creation of dynamic informational assets, leveraging Large Language Models to distill complex information into accessible formats. It focuses on generating insightful slide decks (e.g., cost comparisons, project recaps) and concise, factual summaries, particularly for news content, while maintaining a strong emphasis on developer productivity and code maintainability.

## Key Features & Capabilities

*   **LLM-Powered Content Generation:** Dynamically produces diverse content, including:
    *   **Factuality Summaries:** Generates concise, factual summaries, ideal for news or research.
    *   **Cost-Comparison Slides:** Automates the creation of presentations comparing costs.
    *   **Recap Slides:** Efficiently generates summary presentations for projects or events.
*   **Automated Content Delivery:** Streamlined workflow for deploying all generated content, including slide decks, to GitHub Pages for easy sharing.
*   **Robust Local Development:** Features an optimized developer experience with isolated environments, deterministic dependency management, and live-reloading for rapid iteration.
*   **Integrated Code Quality:** Enforces consistent code style and quality standards from the very beginning using `pre-commit` hooks.
*   **Open-Source Licensed:** Distributed under the Apache License for broad usability and collaboration.

## Quick Start (For Developers)

To get started with local development and explore the project's capabilities, use the provided `run.sh` script, which sets up your environment automatically:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone your-repository-url-here
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Run the development environment:**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/run.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    *   Set up an isolated Python virtual environment (`venv`).
    *   Install all necessary dependencies deterministically using `pip-tools` (ensuring reproducibility).
    *   Start the main application with live-reloading enabled, providing instant feedback on code changes.

## Technical Highlights

This project showcases several best practices and interesting technical approaches:

*   **Sophisticated Local Development Loop:** Demonstrates a highly effective and reproducible development environment using `venv` for isolation, `pip-tools` with dependency hashing for security and consistency, and `entr` for intelligent live-reloading.
*   **Adaptive LLM Integration:** Provides practical insights into working with external LLM APIs, including strategies for model selection and adaptation (e.g., switching from `1.5-pro` to `1.5-flash` to mitigate truncation issues), showcasing real-world problem-solving.
*   **Unified Content Deployment Strategy:** Implements a consolidated GitHub Pages deployment workflow for various content types, simplifying CI/CD and ensuring consistent content delivery.
*   **Proactive Code Quality:** The integration of `pre-commit` hooks ensures high code standards from the initial commit, fostering a clean and maintainable codebase throughout the project lifecycle.
