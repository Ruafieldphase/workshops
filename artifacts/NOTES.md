### NOTES.md: Commit 811775f - Artifacts, Pre-commit, Factuality

This commit marks a significant expansion of the project's capabilities, primarily focusing on the automated generation and serving of interactive web "artifacts," alongside foundational improvements in development hygiene and the introduction of a new content domain: factuality. The overarching problem being solved is to move beyond static, manually curated content towards dynamically generated, self-contained interactive experiences and information summaries.

Our technical approach for artifact generation centers around leveraging `CrewAI` to orchestrate an `Artifactor` agent. This agent is specifically designed with the role of a "Web Developer/Designer," tasked with creating fully self-contained HTML documents. A key architectural decision was to ensure these generated artifacts embed all necessary resources—including inline CSS for styling, embedded JavaScript for interactivity, and images encoded as Base64 data URIs—within a single HTML file. This design choice maximizes portability, enables offline functionality, and simplifies distribution. The initial demonstration of this capability includes dynamic physics simulations, specifically a two-pendulum system with user controls, showcasing the agent's ability to synthesize complex interactive experiences from a simple textual query. Furthermore, a new Caddyfile has been added to the `artifacts/` directory, providing a robust, lightweight static file server with appropriate CORS headers, streamlining local development and serving of these interactive components.

A notable implementation detail and challenge overcome during development involved the choice of the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) for the `Artifactor` agent. Initially, `gemini-1.5-pro` caused truncation issues with the generated content, leading to incomplete artifacts. This was successfully worked around by switching the agent's LLM to `gemini-1.5-flash`, which resolved the truncation and allowed for full artifact generation. Beyond the interactive simulations, this commit also diversifies the project's content generation capabilities by introducing "factuality" features, aiming to summarize news and generate related presentation slides, indicating a broader vision for AI-driven content creation.

Finally, crucial developer experience and compliance improvements were integrated. The adoption of `pre-commit` hooks streamlines code quality checks and consistency across the codebase, ensuring a smoother development workflow. Apache 2.0 licenses have been added across new files and directories, clarifying intellectual property and usage rights. The commit also shows a refinement of the GitHub Pages deployment workflow, including discussions around matrix-based enumeration versus explicit listing for artifact deployment targets, indicating ongoing efforts to optimize our CI/CD pipeline for these new dynamic content types. This commit lays the groundwork for a more autonomous and diverse content generation platform.

## Commit `db5f279`: Doodles, History - Enabling Iterative Artifact Generation

This commit marks a significant pivot in our artifact generation workflow, moving us from a static, single-shot generation paradigm to a dynamic, interactive, and iterative system. Previously, our `main.py` was set up for ad-hoc artifact creation; you'd ask for something, get it, and that was that. Iteration meant restarting from scratch, losing all context from previous generations, which was inefficient and hampered the development of complex UIs.

The core problem being solved was the lack of **iterative refinement and statefulness** in our artifact generation process. We needed a way for the LLM to "remember" its previous output and for developers to guide the generation step-by-step. The technical approach taken introduces an interactive loop in `artifacts/main.py` where the user can continuously provide new prompts, and critically, the LLM is now provided with its `previous_artifact` as context. This is a key architectural decision: by feeding the LLM its own prior HTML output back into the prompt, we enable true multi-turn conversations and incremental construction of complex web components. Challenges related to maintaining conversational state across multiple generation calls have been overcome by this explicit passing of the `previous_artifact` string.

Implementation-wise, `main.py` now runs a `while user_input` loop, taking user queries and passing them, along with the *last generated artifact*, to the `crew.kickoff` function. The returned HTML artifact is immediately written to `index.html`, providing rapid feedback and easy inspection of the current state. The newly added `artifacts/snake.html` file, along with the updated `TODO.md` referencing "Two pendulum" and "Claude Tetris," serve as concrete examples of the more sophisticated, interactive HTML structures that can now be incrementally built and refined. While the primary focus of the infrastructure changes is on iterative generation, the commit also hints at specific content development, such as "animatable SVGs" for "History of LLMs" slides and a "Timeline," demonstrating that these new capabilities are already being leveraged for dynamic, data-driven visualizations. This marks a substantial step forward in our ability to develop and refine complex interactive experiences with the aid of LLMs.

### Commit 3: Add license (#36) (21a92b1)

### NOTES.md - Commit `21a92b1` - Add license (#36)

This commit, though succinctly titled "Add license," represents a packed development sprint focused on dramatically enhancing the interactivity and visual storytelling capabilities of our presentation framework. The core problem being addressed was the need to transcend static content, particularly for our "History of LLMs" narrative, and deliver a truly dynamic, engaging experience. This also involved general polish and improved navigation across our existing interactive "artifacts" (like the Snake game).

The cornerstone of the technical approach was the "first pass at animatable SVGs." This was a pivotal architectural decision, leveraging SVG's inherent scalability and DOM manipulability to create fluid, interactive graphs and timelines for the LLM history. This enables programmatic animation, allowing data points to evolve, connections to highlight, and narratives to unfold dynamically, a significant step beyond traditional slide decks. Complementing this, an "artifact loop" mechanism was introduced, a crucial design for seamlessly showcasing our various interactive demos (Tetris, Snake, Two Pendulum) in an automated, engaging sequence, likely for exhibitions or continuous demonstrations.

Implementing these features involved overcoming several granular challenges. The commit messages hint at initial hurdles with interaction ("fix clicks, captions") and visual quality ("despeckle to 5"), indicating iterative refinement was necessary to ensure a smooth user experience and crisp visuals. Extensive "CSS changes" were made to ensure aesthetic consistency across these new dynamic elements and existing content. The final "Add license" step, which titles the commit, marks the culmination of these efforts, formalizing the project's intellectual property and signaling a readiness for broader dissemination or deployment of these newly enhanced, feature-rich artifacts. This commit collectively represents a significant leap forward in our interactive content and presentation capabilities.
