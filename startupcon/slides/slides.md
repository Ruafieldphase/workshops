# Concept to Console
## The New AI-Native Game Studio

Our motivating example: an AI-generated game called **"Seoul Slayers."**

<!-- This is the title slide. It sets the stage for the presentation. -->

# Step 1: The Living Mood Board

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

We begin with a vision, not a document. Generative video instantly sets the tone and art style for the entire project.

<br>

> **Prompt for Veo 3:**
> "Cinematic trailer for a game where K-Pop idols hunt demonic spirits in a rain-slicked, neon-drenched Seoul."

</div>
<div>
<video src="/jin-concept-movie.mp4" autoplay loop muted class="rounded-lg shadow-lg"></video>
</div>
</div>

<!-- This slide introduces the ideation phase using a generative video model. -->

---

# Step 2: Character Design & Orthographics

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

With the mood set, we design our hero. AI image models can create detailed character sheets from a single concept image.

<br>

> **Prompt for Nano-Banana:**
> "Generate a character sheet based on the attached image of 'Jin'. Provide four full-body orthographic views: front, back, left side, and right side. The background should be solid white, with no shadows or extra elements. Ensure the character's design, clothing, and proportions are consistent across all views."

</div>
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-center">
<img src="/jin-front.png" class="rounded-lg max-h-[25vh]" />
<img src="/jin-back.png" class="rounded-lg max-h-[25vh]" />
<img src="/jin-left.png" class="rounded-lg max-h-[25vh]" />
<img src="/jin-right.png" class="rounded-lg max-h-[25vh]" />
</div>
</div>

<!-- This slide covers character sheet generation. -->

# Step 3: From 2D Concept to 3D Character

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

These orthographics guide the AI in generating a game-ready, fully-articulated 3D asset.

<br>

> **Prompt for Character Model:**
> "Generate a stylized 3D model of 'Jin', our main hero, from these reference images, in a modern K-Pop warrior style."

</div>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center">
<video src="/jin-walking.mp4" autoplay loop muted class="rounded-lg shadow-lg max-h-[60vh]"></video>
</div>
</div>

# Step 4: Instantly Playable Worlds

The game needs a setting. We can now generate a playable, explorable 3D world from a single piece of concept art.

<br>

> **Prompt for Genie:**
> "Create a playable, modern urban landscape based on this concept art of a futuristic Myeongdong market."

<!-- This slide covers the creation of the game environment. -->

# Step 5: The Adaptive Soundtrack

A world needs a soundtrack. The AI generates music that dynamically adapts to the player's actions in real-time.

<br>

> **Prompt for Lyria:**
> "Generate a chill, lo-fi K-Pop track for exploration that seamlessly transitions into a high-energy battle anthem."

<!-- This slide is about generating the game's music. -->

---

# Step 6: Unscripted Dialogue & Companions

The world is populated with characters you can talk to. Players use their own voice, and AI companions respond with unscripted dialogue.

<br>

> **Prompt for Gemini Live:**
> No prompt needed. The AI acts as a character's brain, enabling real, spontaneous conversations with the player.

<!-- This slide focuses on dynamic NPCs and player interaction. -->

# Step 7: Orchestrating the AI Studio

The final step is integration. All AI-generated assets—characters, worlds, music, and logic—are orchestrated by an AI-powered game engine.

<br>

> This represents the final assembly, where tools like Unity's AI bring all the generated pieces together into a cohesive, playable experience.

<!-- This slide explains how all the AI-generated components are brought together. -->

# The New Creator: From Builder to Director

The creator's job is no longer to build, but to guide.
To act as the creative director for a studio of AI agents.

<!-- This is the concluding slide, summarizing the shift in the creator's role. -->
